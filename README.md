# Project 3 - Illumination

[TODO]

## Usage

[TODO]

Get a local copy of the repository by downloading the zip or using `git clone`. This includes a makefile which allows you to simply `make` the project as long as you are in a *UNIX-like* environment.

Then, depending on your operating system/environment, you can run the program by using one of the following commands:

```
./raycast.exe 100 100 objects.csv output.ppm
```
```
raycast 100 100 objects.csv output.ppm
```

The first two numbers represent width and height (respectively). `objects.csv` is a CSV file in which each line represents an object (camera, sphere, plane) and its properties (width, height, color, position, radius, normal). Finally, `output.ppm` is the name of the PPM file to be created.

## Examples

## Known Issues/Strange Behavior
